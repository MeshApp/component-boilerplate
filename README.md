### MeshApp Component Boilerplate

This boilerplate will create a ready to use package of your component,
to be loaded into the mainframe of the meshapp-webapp,

You can insert your developed component and build it,
or you can start from scratch.

After adding your component just run

```
yarn run lib
```
